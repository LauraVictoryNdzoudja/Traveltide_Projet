The project involves using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to create metrics that characterize and group customers for TravelTide. 
By identifying key attributes from the session data, meaningful features are devised to differentiate customers. 
These metrics can be aggregated and combined to reveal patterns, such as customer preferences and behaviors.

For customer segmentation, predefined groupings or machine learning-based clustering methods are applied. 
The goal is to identify distinct customer segments, analyze their characteristics, and tailor strategies for each group. 
Visual insights from the analysis can be viewed via the provided Tableau dashboard.
